- "2. I've actually thought about this before. The exact color brown of that pair of boots you wore in Europe and still wear all the time (at least as far as I know). It's a trusty color and weathered because you've experienced a lot but those boots have been on 3(yes?) continents with you and still made it through. They go with pretty much everything just like you fit in everywhere you go. You really can't go wrong with them, and you know you can take them to any environment and they'll serve you well, the way that you can work well in any situation you're faced with. Those boots practically scream Jack Kerouac and so do you." Lex
